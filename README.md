# Ionic + Express + Sequelize + Multer Example

This is a basic example using Ionic + Express + Sequelize + Multer that shows how to upload/download images using Multer.

It captures images in Ionic, and pick photos up as well using Ionic Capacitor.

## Prerequisites

All you need is... some time and...
* Visual Studio Code.
* Ionic.

* More hours than you first could think of...


## Things that I have done

I wanted to make something apart from the base that we did in class, so I tried to put a delete all button, that allows you to delete instantly all the data from the list (the images get deleted too), and I tried to make a filter or something similar, but i couldn't because of time problems :(

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The Editor used in this project
* [Ionic 6](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro) - Ionic Framework is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
